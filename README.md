## Brand-Market-Penetration

#### Objective:

In this project, I will evaluate Shein's Performance in European Markets Over Last 8 months. I will do this by providing comprehensive analysis in the three areas listed below:

* Social Media Brand Mentions Analysis
* Customer Feedback Analysis
* Comparative Review Analysis

#### Steps to success

Step 1: Data gathering

a) YouTube API Data Extraction: Using the YouTube API, I will extract relevant data points associated with videos containing the "shein" hashtag. The columns will be video ID, likes, views, comments, the top-engaged comment.

b) Trustpilot Online Review Extraction: I will webscrape online reviews of Shein from the Trustpilot platform. I will focus on collecting key data fields such as the review publication date, country of origin, rating score, title, and textual content of the review itself.

Write all the above into a central database sdata


Step 2: Data Preprocessing & Analysis

a) Sentiment Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Data: My goal is to scrutinize Shein brand mentions utilizing YouTube data, performing sentiment analysis on the text data and exploratory data analysis on the accompanying numerical metrics (likes, comments, and view counts).

b) Exploratory Data Analysis and Sentiment Analysis on Trustpilot Reviews: For this task, I will investigate customer feedback for Shein through Trustpilot reviews. Using exploratory data analysis, I will look through the data, followed by applying sentiment analysis techniques to classify the underlying tone of the text data into positive and negative sentiments.

c) Competitive Benchmarking - SheIn vs. Temu and Aliexpress: Lastly, I will engage in a thorough comparative evaluation of online reviews for Shein against its major rivals in the fast fashion sector, namely Temu and Aliexpress to discern meaningful distinctions and similarities between the companies.
